      <h1>reLearn CSS - 100 Day Challenge</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I have been a full-stack engineer(frontend:backend = 6:4) for a while. Like many of my peers, I use Google and StackOverflow <strong>FREQUENTLY</strong> to help solve my problems, especially the ones about goddamn CSS.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I kept writing(mostly copy-paste-tweaking) hundreds of lines of CSS. To be honest, they don't look bad. I could follow this pattern and work happily until either I or CSS retires.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Things don't go as expected, always. One day, I suddenly got fed up with searching for a certain CSS attribute while building a D3 chart. This strong feeling just stroke me: <strong>I DON'T WANNA WRITE CSS LIKE THIS ANYMORE.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        After 10 minutes, I decided to reLearn CSS, and built this page to keep track of the process. I am not a persistent guy. Hope this could last a little longer than my other half-way done projects.
